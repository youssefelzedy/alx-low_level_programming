# 0x03. C - Debugging

1 - In most projects, we often give you only one main file to test with. For example, this main file is a test for a postitive_or_negative() function similar to the one you worked with in an earlier C project:


2 - Copy this main file. Comment out (don’t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.


        - Don’t add or remove any lines of code, as we will be checking your line count. You are only allowed to comment out existing code.
        - You do not have to compile with -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic for this task.


3 - This program prints the largest of three integers.


4 - This program converts a date to the day of year and determines how many days are left in the year, taking leap year into consideration.

    - Fix the print_remaining_days() function so that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years.

        - Line count will not be checked for this task.
        - You can assume that all test cases have valid months (i.e. the value of month will never be less than 1 or greater than 12) and valid days (i.e. the value of day will never be less than 1 or greater than 31).
        - You can assume that all test cases have valid month/day combinations (i.e. there will never be a June 31st or
